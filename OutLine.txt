**Morphological and Functional Differences in Neurons of the Primary Visual Area and the Rostrolateral Visual Area**

---

**Primary Visual Cortex (V1):**

* **Function:** First cortical area to receive visual input from the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. Crucial for basic visual processing such as edges, orientation, motion, and color.
* **Neuronal Morphology:** Neurons in V1—particularly pyramidal cells—have dense, highly organized dendritic arbors. These neurons are specialized for detecting specific visual features like orientation, direction of motion, and color.

**Rostrolateral Visual Area (RL):**

* **Function:** Involved in higher-level visual processing and in integrating visual information from multiple sources.
* **Neuronal Morphology:** Neurons in RL tend to exhibit more extensive and complex dendritic arbors compared to those in V1, supporting a greater degree of sensory integration.

**Structural Features to Examine:**

* Fractal dimension
* Number of bifurcations
* Distribution of bifurcation angles
* Mean segment length

**Functional Analysis:**

1. For each neuron, query the Allen Institute API to retrieve the coordinates of axonal terminals (“leaves”).
2. Label each terminal by its corresponding brain compartment.
3. Compare the distributions of axonal terminals in V1 versus RL to identify differences in functional connectivity.

Because the roles of these two areas differ substantially, we expect to observe both structural and functional divergences between neurons in V1 and RL.

On the MouseLight Neuron Browser there are data for 126 axons in V1 and 31 in RL.
Please let me know if you consider the choice of areas and the selected features appropriate.
