## Overview

This project explores how neuronal shape and connectivity vary across three cortical regions in the mouse:  
- **VISp**: processes basic visual features (edges, orientation).  
- **VISal**: integrates motion, depth, and complex form.  
- **SSp_bfd**: encodes tactile input from whiskers via barrel-shaped columns.  

By quantifying dendritic geometry and graph-based connectivity, we identify region-specific structural signatures.
